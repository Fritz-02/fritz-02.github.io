        <p>
          Hello! I just like to make random projects, especially for destiny.gg
          as seen by the many DGG-related repos{' '}
          <a href="/projects" className="text-blue-400 hover:underline">
            here
          </a>
          .
        </p>
        <p>I know Python, Javascript, Typescript, and some React.</p>
        <p>Not sure what else to put here, but this site is a huge WIP :)</p>
      </div>
